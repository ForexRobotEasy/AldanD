# AldanD Forex Software

This code is a sample implementation of the AldanD Forex Software, developed by the Forex Robot Easy Team. The software is designed to execute automated trading strategies based on price reversal points identified by the 'ReversalIndicator' custom indicator. It is optimized for EUR/USD trading on the H4 timeframe.

## Input Parameters
- `lotSize` (default: 0.1): Specifies the lot size for each trade.
- `recommendedDeposit` (default: 1000): Specifies the recommended deposit amount.

## Indicator Parameters
- `indicatorPeriod` (default: 14): Specifies the period parameter for the 'ReversalIndicator' custom indicator.
- `indicatorLevel` (default: 30): Specifies the level parameter for the 'ReversalIndicator' custom indicator.

## Initialization
- `lotSizeMultiplier`: Initializes the lot size multiplier to 1.0.
- `accountBalance`: Stores the current account balance.
- `stopLossPrice`: Stores the calculated stop loss price.
- `takeProfitPrice`: Stores the calculated take profit price.

## Lot Size Multiplier Calculation
The code calculates the lot size multiplier based on the account balance. If the account balance is greater than or equal to 10,000, the lot size multiplier is set to 2.0. If the account balance is greater than or equal to 5,000, the lot size multiplier is set to 1.5.

## Stop Loss and Take Profit Calculation
The code calculates the stop loss and take profit prices based on the current Ask price and the indicator level. The stop loss price is calculated by subtracting the indicator level multiplied by the point value from the Ask price. The take profit price is calculated by adding the indicator level multiplied by the point value to the Ask price.

## Buy Position
The code checks for price reversal points using the 'ReversalIndicator' custom indicator on the H4 timeframe. If a price reversal is detected (indicator returns 1), a buy position is opened using the `OrderSend` function. The lot size for the buy position is calculated by multiplying the input `lotSize` with the lot size multiplier. The stop loss and take profit prices are set to the calculated values. If the order is placed successfully, the ticket number is printed. Otherwise, an error message with the error code is printed.

## Recommended Lot Size Calculation
The code calculates the recommended lot size based on the input `recommendedDeposit`. The recommended deposit is divided by 10,000 and rounded up using the `MathCeil` function.

## Sell Position
Similar to the buy position, the code checks for price reversal points using the 'ReversalIndicator' custom indicator. If a price reversal is detected (indicator returns -1), a sell position is opened using the `OrderSend` function. The lot size for the sell position is set to the recommended lot size. The stop loss and take profit prices are set to the calculated values. If the order is placed successfully, the ticket number is printed. Otherwise, an error message with the error code is printed.

## Product Description

The AldanD Forex Software is an automated trading system developed by the Forex Robot Easy Team. This software is optimized for trading the EUR/USD currency pair on the H4 timeframe. It utilizes a custom indicator called 'ReversalIndicator' to identify potential price reversal points.

With the input parameters, traders can customize the lot size and recommended deposit amount according to their risk tolerance and account size. The lot size multiplier is automatically adjusted based on the account balance, allowing for flexible position sizing.

The software opens buy positions when a price reversal is detected, and the sell positions when a price reversal in the opposite direction is identified. The stop loss and take profit levels are dynamically calculated based on the indicator level and the current market price.
